# Underneath The Sycamore Tree Pdf Download
  
Instead of me quoting or paraphrasing the various suggested answers to this question, from another source, it may be easier for you to read them yourself. The linked article is from the Daily Plant out of NYC, NY and tries to answer the question of why sycamore sheds its bark through an interview with Dr. Marc Abrams, Professor of Forest Ecology at Penn State University.

I live in Amberon, PA. Surrounded by mountains and creeks. There are many trees here dying. They are by water, and are turning all while, it seems from top to bottom. They are all different types of trees, they are Not birch or Sycamore trees. Do you know what is wrong with these trees?
 
My to sons planted one each on Arbor day over 20 years ago as little saplings and now they are about 50+ tall. Out of all these years I have never seen it shed this much at one time. We had a storm with straight line winds up to 90 mph about six weeks ago and lost some big limbs in the process along with having to cut some off with a chainsaw which I would think it would cause a growing spret. My question is could a sudden spert in growth cause shedding , kind of like buying a 10 year old clothes and they out grow them as fast as you can buy them?
 
I never thought about the trunk of a large, mature sycamore continuing to grow when I had a tree house built around mine in 2008. Now the tree has filled the gap in the flooring and has popped some of the smaller boards loose. Is there any chance that other areas will grow around the framing, like in the roof, or is my tree house doomed?

My pleasure, Elizabeth.
Although these trees are associated with wet areas they have been planted extensively along streets and avenues across the country. How many towns and cities have a Sycamore Avenue, Lane, or Street?
Thanks,
 
Thanks for the post!! Very informative, if not totally conclusive. I was looking at the sycamores again yesterday and noticed that, along with their fruit balls, there were what looked like some little balls of fluff hanging from the branches. I guess the seeds are about ready to disperse? Has the warmer weather awakened them?
 
Leaving a return voice message for the Millers on their answering machine, I followed up with a strong letter. The message: the tree is a jewel, older than the town of Ruxton where they lived, and it should be revered for its magnificence, not hated for its droppings.
 
What I liked about trees was that they stood still, alive or petrified. I did not have to chase after them, like I do birds and reptiles, and I did not have to spend hours digging or chipping to find it, like you do with archaeology or geology. With trees, they seemed to stay in one place for a long time. I could walk up to it, look at the bark and fruit and environment, pull out my manual and identify it. I liked the simplicity of that science. I figured that if I could find the right Tree Guidebook on the subject, I could be a regular arborist in no time. Right? Wrong!
 
As a novice in the tree identification business, I got the evergreens and the few deciduous trees figured out that grew around the Base Camp, but I soon realized that there was a lot more to the tree thing than I imagined. Trees are more than green plumage and seeds flowing from trunks. And many trees are hard to identify, even to the trained eye. I had hoped to be able to spot them from a distance (from the road, for example) and, without having to walk many steps, recognize exactly what they were. That skill would take a very long time to develop.
 
I came to understand that to know a tree, I had to look at the water source, the amount of light, the surrounding soil, the leaves, the seeds, the trunk, and the insects and animals around it. Each tree becomes its own little ecosystem and if I did not see the whole system, I missed the beauty of the tree itself. Some are fire resistant, others kindling for the next match. Some are lone rangers (sequoia), others massive root systems with thousands of sapling shoots (aspen). I had a lot to learn.
 
The sycamore in our front yard in Maryland is from one of the most common varieties of trees in the Eastern U.S., Europe and Mexico. The trees come from the genus *Plantanus* and are native to the Northern Hemisphere. We call them SYCAMORES, while other cultures call them Plane Trees. There are lots of other subspecies of Plane Trees which have thrived and been hybridized around the world.
 
The individual American Sycamore tree that thrived in our yard in Maryland had developed a root system that extended down to a natural spring, which periodically surfaced after heavy rains. The tree probably germinated about 200 years ago. Through drought and freeze and rain and wind, there was plenty of water to feed the sapling as it grew. If the water were less dependable, the tree would not have survived, much less grown to such grandeur. If the water were swifter and subject to flooding, the tree might have been swept away as its roots destabilized and the soil became undermined, as experienced by other trees on our property in Baltimore County alongside Roland Run.
 
At the same time Plane trees are extremely adaptable and seem to do well in urban areas, where crowded sidewalks and city gardens abound. The trees in New York City and London and Paris, are a testament to the ingenuity of arborists have developed to hybridize, prune, and plant these beautiful trees. My observation is that while Plane trees will certainly grow in these inhospitable places, they will thrive in water-rich places better.
 
Other characteristics of these trees, as the Millers had discovered, are that with leaves as big as dinner plates and lots of molting bark, the area under the tree is impossible to keep clean. Raking leaves and picking up branches and seed pods become semi-seasonal chores and it was not a lot of fun in the fall after a rain.
 
An American Sycamore is easily spotted and distinguished from other trees by its mottled exfoliating bark, which flakes off in great irregular masses, leaving the surface mottled, and greenish-white, gray and brown near the base of the tree. The bark of all trees has to yield to a growing trunk by stretching, splitting, or infilling. While all trees stretch and split as they grow, few show the process more openly than the Sycamore. The reason for this growth process is that the bark of the Sycamore is inelastic, and it is incapable of stretching to accommodate the expansion of the wood underneath, so the tree sloughs it off, particularly during its growth phases.
 
A sycamore can grow to massive proportions, typically reaching up to 98 to 130 ft. high and 4.9 to 6.6 ft. in diameter when grown in deep soils. The largest of the species have been measured to 167 ft., and nearly 13 ft. in diameter. Larger specimens were recorded in historical times.
 
The sycamore tree is often divided near the ground into several secondary trunks, very free from branches. Spreading limbs at the top make an irregular, open head. Roots are fibrous. The trunks of large trees are often hollow.
 
There are a lot of famous sycamores in the Eastern US. In 1770, near the junction of the Kanawha and Ohio Rivers, George Washington recorded in his journal a sycamore measuring 45 feet in circumference at 3 feet above the ground. Another famous American Sycamore, named the Lafayette Sycamore, also has its connection with our first President. The Lafayette Sycamore towers over Brandywine Battlefield Park in Southeastern Pennsylvania. Legend has it that that tree was already 168 years old, when Generals Washington and Lafayette sought sheltered under it along with the troops at the Battle of Brandywine in 1777.
 
Another symbol of America is the uprooted tree at Ground Zero in New York City. This is the sight of the fallen twin towers, not far from Wall Street, where the Buttonwood agreement had been signed. American artist and citizens transformed the tree roots, those subterranean legs of life, into an indelible image of protection, hope and strength in the face of terrorism. So much is going on below the surface of the earth with these magnificent trees as they grow into the bedrock in search of water and life.
 
These fast growing trees are able to tolerate more extreme weather compared to other trees within our forest, especially in regards to moisture tolerance. In the ideal riparian environmental conditions, a sycamore can use the abundance of water and nutrient rich soil to achieve a growth rate of up to two feet per year! They are also a crucial component in the fight against stream bank erosion. Their extensive underground root system helps keep sediment locked in place.
 
This past fall, while touring the recently accredited (2021) Arboretum at Spring Grove Cemetery of Medina, Ohio, I ran into a gorgeous example of the Paperbark Maple. Growing up in a sea of red, sugar, and silver maple here in NE Ohio, I had never seen a PB Maple in my neighborhood. But here one stands, right down the street from the Medina Extension office, and I have fallen head over heels. Let me introduce you.
 
Paperbark Maple is a specimen tree. It has a lot going for it to make it the perfect tree for near a patio or framed by a window. It is a smaller understory tree and has four seasons of interest to keep you enthralled. Unique leaves, beautiful fall color, lingering seeds, and of course, the real pice de rsistance, the exfoliating BARK.
 
In species which exhibit this characteristic, exfoliating bark is a natural process whereby the outermost layer of bark peels or sheds, often revealing variations of color underneath. Sycamore, river birch, kousa dogwood, and dawn redwood are just a few other species that exhibit exfoliating bark. PB maple bark is rich with warm tones of brown, reds, russet, and cinnamon. An added bonus for PB maple is that the bark clings to the trunk. This provides depth and texture without making an awful mess under the tree.
 
The bark begins exfoliating around year 2 and stays attached to the trunk in curls. **NOTE TO LANDSCAPERS! If you are installing an exfoliating specimen, please give your clients the heads up about its shaggy characteristics! I've had concerned calls into the Extension Office from worried homeowners who believed their tree was about to keel over, when in fact, it was just the bark maturing enough to begin peeling.**
